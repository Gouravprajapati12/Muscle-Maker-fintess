                <h2><span>Goals:</span> People go to the gym for different reasons, such as building strength, improving
                    cardiovascular health, or losing weight. Understanding individual fitness goals is crucial for
                    designing an effective workout plan. <br><br>

                    <span>Equipment:</span> Gyms offer a wide range of equipment, from free weights and resistance machines to cardio
                    machines and functional training equipment. Choosing the right equipment for a specific workout can
                    help maximize the benefits.<br><br>

                    <span>Safety:</span> Safety is a top priority in any gym. Proper use of equipment, proper form during exercises,
                    and avoiding overexertion are essential for injury prevention.<br><br>

                    <span>Progression:</span> In order to see results, it's important to progress gradually over time. This can
                    involve increasing weight, reps, or intensity. A gym-goer's progression should be monitored and
                    adjusted as needed.<br><br>

                    <span>Recovery:</span> Recovery is just as important as the workout itself. Proper rest, nutrition, and hydration
                    are necessary for optimal recovery and preventing injury.</h2>
