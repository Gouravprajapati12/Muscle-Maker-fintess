                <h3><span>Protein: </span> Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue. Good sources of protein
                    include chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, beans, and lentils. <br><br>

                    <span>Healthy Fats:</span> Healthy fats are important for overall health and can provide sustained energy during
                    workouts. Good sources of healthy fats include avocado, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish like
                    salmon.<br><br>
                    <span>Water: </span> Staying hydrated is crucial for optimal performance in the gym. Aim to drink at least 8-10
                    glasses of water per day, and more if you're sweating heavily during your workouts.<br><br>

                    <span>Vitamins and minerals:</span> Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables can provide your body with
                    important vitamins and minerals that support your overall health and fitness goals. In particular,
                    vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc can help support a healthy immune system, which is important for
                    athletes who are training regularly.</h3>
